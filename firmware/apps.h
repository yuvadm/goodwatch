     ring a doorbell or buzz a dog collar without taking the trouble
     to manually enter it.  For those cases, we have a fallthrough
     handler with the same calling convention as the keypress()
     function.  They might even be defined to the same handler.
     
     For now, only the clock applet falls through to another, and it
     only falls through for the buttons 1,2,3,-.  This is subject to
     change.
